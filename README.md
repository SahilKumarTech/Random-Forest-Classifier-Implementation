# Random-Forest-Classifier-Implementation
Basic implementation of the Random Forest algorithm using Python and scikit-learn. The notebook includes dataset preprocessing, model training, and evaluation with performance metrics and visualizations.

This project demonstrates a **basic implementation of the Random Forest algorithm** for classification tasks.  
The notebook covers dataset preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Load Dataset** – Import a sample dataset for classification.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean and prepare the dataset for training.
3. **Model Training** – Train a Random Forest Classifier with scikit-learn.
4. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluate using:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix
5. **Feature Importance** – Identify the most important features used by the model.
6. **Visualization** – Plot confusion matrix and feature importance.
